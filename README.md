Base WP Plugin is a **starter** WordPress plugin to use as a base to build WordPress plugins from scratch. Contains the configuration files for handling the assets files like Javascript, CSS, and images using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
It uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to handle [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) and autoloader. The WordPress hooks (actions and filters) are registered using a custom **initialize() method** instead to hook them in the \_\_constructor of each class. This `initialize method` is automatically called in the Init class (It seems overengineering now, but will be useful as you plugin grows up).

Some topics covered in this project:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for managing, compiling, and optimizing the plugin's asset files;
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/);
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/);
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/);
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/);
- [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards);
- [PHP Namespaces](http://php.net/manual/pl/language.namespaces.php);
- [Autoload](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php);

# Usage

Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/sarahcssiqueira/base-wp-plugin` or download the latest [release](https://github.com/sarahcssiqueira/base-wp-plugin/releases). Place it in the **/wp-content/plugins/** folder of your WordPress installation.

# Development

## Start Development Server

- `npm run dev`

## Run PHPCS

- `composer cs`
- `composer cbf`

# Build

To optimize and minify assets to the build folder with wepback run:

- `npm run build`

### PHP Classes

Classes are automatically loaded by the Init class with the method **register_classes_list**:

```
    /**
	 * Loop through the classes list, initialize them,
	 * and call the initialize() method if it exists
	 */
	public static function register_classes_list() {
		foreach ( self::classes_list() as $class ) {
			$classname = self::instantiate( $class );
			if ( method_exists( $classname, 'initialize' ) ) {
				$classname->initialize();
			}
		}
	}
```

To add your new classes, make sure add them to the array present in the method **classes_list**:

```
	/**
	 * Store the classes inside an array
	 *
	 * @return array Full list of classes
	 */
	public static function classes_list() {
		return [
			Plugin::class,
            YourNewClass::class,
		];
	}
```
